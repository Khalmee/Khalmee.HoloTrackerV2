This is a Titanfall 2 mod usable with the [Northstar Client](https://github.com/R2Northstar/Northstar). It is also listed on [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/northstar/p/Khalmee/HoloTracker_V2/).

# HoloTracker V2
Tracks your decoy's position and remaining lifetime on HUD. Standalone, client-side version.

When the decoy leaves your FOV, the tracker is still visible near the edge of the screen. 
The tracker disappears once the decoy is killed or begins to dissolve. Works with both the pilot ability and the boost.

In this version (unlike in HoloTracker V1) there are **no dependencies**, and the mod can function purely on client **without the need to rely on Holoshift**.
The mod can be used both in Northstar servers and Vanilla servers.
